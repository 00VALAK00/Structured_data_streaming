## About the project
The objective of this project is to Generate and Consume sensors data in real-time and then store it to the database for later processing and for this we need:
-Kafka : Event streaming platform (ESP): produce the messages 
-Sparkâ€™ s structured streaming API : consume the messages, comfy them to a schema and store it to db
-cassandra : (wide-column store optimized for data retrieval and writing)
